    <title>Facebook says it will allow more explicit posts if they are newsworthy</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SjBTCHlg1leYLQ4BP0t8DpbiQs=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51454611/facebook-new-news-feed1_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Facebook will begin allowing more explicit posts if they are "newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest," the company said today, following a series of controversies over deleted content. "Our intent is to allow more images and stories without posing safety risks or showing graphic images to minors and others who do not want to see them," said&amp;nbsp; Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy, and Justin Osofsky, vice president of global operations and media partnerships,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/10/input-from-community-and-partners-on-our-community-standards/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Facebook has been under increasing pressure to relax its community standards to allow for posts that include violence or nudity in some contexts. Yesterday the company apologized after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/facebook-bans-swedish-breast-cancer-awareness-video-for-being-offensive"&gt;removing a video from the Swedish Cancer Society that promoted breast cancer awareness&lt;/a&gt; with simple animations of the female body. Last month, Facebook sparked an outcry by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/9/12865670/facebook-censorship-napalm-girl-aftenposten-reversal"&gt;removing an iconic photo from the Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. (It later reversed itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q class="center"&gt;"Respecting local norms and upholding global practices often come into conflict."&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The company offered few details about how it plans to allow more sensitive content to be posted. "We will work with our community and partners to explore exactly how to do this, both through new tools and approaches to enforcement," Kaplan and Osofsky said. They noted that standards vary from culture to culture, and that decisions around newsworthiness or public interest are often highly subjective. "Respecting local norms and upholding global practices often come into conflict," they said. "And people often disagree about what standards should be in place to ensure a community that is both safe and open to expression."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course, Facebook could hire human editors to help make those decisions.&amp;nbsp;But, well,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/30/12702478/facebook-trending-topics-fake-news-megyn-kelly"&gt;you know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Refreshing The Verge: no platform like home</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9mB04M941fNPLYe1cWgXvDjo18s=/0x102:612x510/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51454019/19b012aca93511e2bb6b22000a9f3c09_7.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p id="r1T5Qa"&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; turns five on November 1st, and we’re in the process of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13149464/the-verge-redesign-refresh-five-intro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;refreshing our entire brand for the next five years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. In &lt;/em&gt;Refreshing&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;, we’ll be looking at how that refresh process works, and what it’s like to adapt a brand like &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; to a world where media platforms have become dominant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="5vEUnG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the biggest advantages The Verge has always had is Vox Media’s own proprietary publishing platform, Chorus. As we think about building The Verge for a future where other media platforms command more and more of our audience’s attention, the needs and demands of Chorus have also changed — what started as an efficient tool for writing articles and publishing a website now needs to become a system for creating a wide range of formats and managing distribution to multiple platforms. In this installment, I’ve asked Mandy Brown, Vox Media’s Director of Publishing, to talk about the future of &lt;/em&gt;our&lt;em&gt; platform — and really, the future of publishing tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="DfVY8P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Nilay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="drzOnt"&gt;
      &lt;p id="I1yKp7"&gt;In writing &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13271182/refreshing-the-verge-writing-a-new-mission-statement"&gt;a new mission statement for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13271182/refreshing-the-verge-writing-a-new-mission-statement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nilay notes that the core difference in media between today and five years ago is the preponderance of platforms: we are no longer building a single platform where our audience will find us, but must instead populate content across many platforms, each with their own unique proclivities. That doesn’t mean that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s website no longer matters, it means it’s now only one among many platforms that we have to attend to.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="pa4GHW"&gt;With Google AMP among the fastest growing of those platforms, Nilay is &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13188306/refreshing-the-verge-facebook-video-google-amp-future-of-the-web"&gt;understandably skeptical&lt;/a&gt; about the open web’s future. I’m sympathetic to that — and as the one leading a redesign of the publishing tools on Vox Media’s platform, Chorus, I have to make publishing to AMP and other platforms one of my highest priorities. But I also believe that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (and indeed all of Vox Media’s brands, as well as many other publishers) will find opportunities to experiment on the open web such that it remains a compelling component of the overall platform ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="THKFcO"&gt;Our website is where we have the biggest opportunity to develop new ways of telling stories, independent of the constraints of other platforms. So while it’s very likely that many members of our audience will find that the primary way they read or watch &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is via Google AMP or Facebook video, our own platform will inform those experiences, and will continue to be core to everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q class="center"&gt;our stories have to be resilient&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="UQGiaB"&gt;What does that mean for a publishing platform like Chorus? To start, our stories have to be resilient. A single story may present one way on our own site, another way in the AMP version, and yet other ways in a Facebook Instant Article or on Apple News. Each of these platforms has a lot in common as far as basic storytelling components go, but they also diverge in non-trivial ways: interactions, typographical systems, the presentation and behavior of ads, and the elements we have to play with to express our brand’s identities may all differ from platform to platform.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="Uw7Kas"&gt;Perhaps ironically, we’ve found that the best way to create that resiliency is by harking back to the web principle of &lt;em&gt;progressive enhancement&lt;/em&gt;: each story created in Chorus begins as a platform-neutral collection of text, images, and video. That foundation ensures that we can publish that story as easily to our own platform as to, say, AMP or Apple News, and be confident that our audience will experience that story in a way that fits whichever platform they are using. On our own platform, we’re then free to enhance up, adding stylistic or experiential flairs that elevate the experience of the story. This practice — which I refer to unoriginally as &lt;em&gt;progressively enhanced storytelling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— also has the added benefit of helping us make our content more &lt;a href="http://accessibility.voxmedia.com"&gt;accessible&lt;/a&gt; to more kinds of users, especially those with disabilities. (It wouldn’t be inaccurate to consider speaking browsers one among the many platforms we must publish to.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="3IDhU4"&gt;There’s another core change in media over the past five years, which Nilay has also noted: our audience is spending as much time &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; content as reading it, if not more. The explosive growth of Facebook video has many in the news business sobbing over the death of text, but I am again unconvinced: I think video growth is expanding the ways we can reach our audience, not cannibalizing time spent reading. Words will always have the benefit of speed, both in terms of time spent composing and time spent reading. That said, we still produce an order of magnitude more text content than video, and it’s past time for video to do some catching up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q class="center"&gt;we have to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;remix&lt;/em&gt; stories instead of enhancing them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="GNZKbd"&gt;In addition to prioritizing tools for video creators alongside other editorial needs in the months ahead, we’re also facing a shift in how we think of content creation overall. We can progressively enhance stories for platforms like AMP and Instant Articles which take as their core assumption something shaped more or less like an "article." But that breaks down for Facebook video, Instagram, Snapchat, or any number of other platforms. Even video has many different outlets: what makes a Facebook video successful is different from what makes a good YouTube video or an especially shareable Vine. Here we need a different tactic: we have to &lt;em&gt;remix&lt;/em&gt; stories instead of enhancing them, expressing a common message across different media while reusing words, images, video, and brand elements in both coherent and delightful ways. This means a new set of tools and mental models and best practices not only for composing and distributing content, but also for reusing it and reimagining it into different forms. That makes the work of publishing more complex, more generative, and more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="3r9JZu"&gt;And yet it still needs to be &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. The speed of publishing is like one of those famed startup growth charts — a hockey stick shape showing a rapid, even exponential, increase. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; relaunches, we’re also about to take a newly redesigned and refactored Chorus publishing tool out of beta. That beta has many new features to support the new universe of platforms: version control, simultaneous editing, an entirely new data model, platform-agnostic design tools, and more. But our biggest challenge in the months ahead is to simultaneously empower our editorial teams to create more content, across more platforms, without slowing down or losing any of the verve and personality that have made &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; (and our other editorial brands) so popular. As the platform ecosystem becomes more complex, Chorus has to be simultaneously more expressive &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; easier for our teams to use. (In case it’s not already clear, this is a huge fucking challenge, and I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; my job.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q class="center"&gt;More platforms means more places to reach our community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="7AMGoq"&gt;And there’s yet another big shift underway, one which we are still evolving to address: that of &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; in a multi-platform, multi-device world. A site on Chorus is actually referred to as a "community," and collections of communities are known as "networks." That was intentional, and reflects core beliefs going back to the early days of &lt;em&gt;SB Nation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about how a brand (née publisher) was expected to operate. We weren’t — we &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— designing systems where an audience passively consumes our content, but are inviting them in to talk and share and push back and expand. More platforms means more places to publish; it also means more places to reach that community, more places for those discussions to happen, more opportunities for amazing connections to be made. And, alas, many more vectors for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="4snDCW"&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; nor Vox Media generally are the only ones facing this problem, of course, but given that our own platform’s foundation takes community as a critical ingredient, we have an obligation to face it head-on. Even more importantly, the very concept of "community" has changed dramatically in recent years, both with the arrival of significant numbers of orchestrated and persistent harassment campaigns across every platform, and with a seemingly unending election cycle that has made public expressions of white supremacy and misogyny commonplace. This, maybe more than anything, is why our own platform remains so important to what we do: it’s where we have the biggest opportunity to really connect with our audience, to build relationships that go deeper than likes, and to cultivate a space where more people can safely talk about the news or tech or sports.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="zzYc92"&gt;As we continue to evolve Chorus, no other challenge we face is harder than this one. But then no other challenge is more important either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ExoMars lander may have exploded when it hit the surface of Mars</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o38qtl8lI_uhgTy3fECNkwDYRK8=/55x0:646x394/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51454409/CvMuX7FWcAAuJQX.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p id="TAcSZV"&gt;The European Space Agency says that its Schiaparelli lander, the ExoMars spacecraft that attempted to land on Mars on Wednesday, &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter_views_Schiaparelli_landing_site"&gt;may have exploded when it hit the surface&lt;/a&gt;. The ESA reached that conclusion after pictures taken by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) show a black spot in the area where the probe should have landed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="PuUSCK"&gt;Schiaparelli was meant to test ESA’s landing technology in view of a future rover the space agency wants to land on Mars in 2020. The probe was equipped with a heat shield, a parachute, and a series of thrusters to help slow its 13,000-miles-per-hour fall through the thin Martian atmosphere. But signals from Schiaparelli cut out before it reached the ground, leaving scientists wondering what had gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
      &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nz8bBMa4UNSV4k-3b15um2wuSiY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7321973/Schiaparelli_landing_site_node_full_image_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS, Arizona State University&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schiaparelli’s landing site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;p id="IILuQq"&gt;The photos captured by the MRO’s low-resolution CTX camera show two new features on the surface when compared to an image from the same camera taken in May. One feature is bright, and ESA thinks it’s Schiaparelli’s parachute. The second feature is a fuzzy dark patch roughly 49 feet by 31 feet in size. ESA thinks that’s a sign that the lander crashed on the surface after its thrusters switched off prematurely; the space agency estimates the impact happened at 186 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="l1LhBK"&gt;There are lots of ways to confirm this using other observational techniques. Next week, the Mars orbiter’s highest resolution camera will take more pictures of the same place, which may reveal more about Schiaparelli’s fate. ESA is also analyzing data from the lander’s mothership, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), which successfully put itself in orbit around Mars on Wednesday. Another source of information are the measurements made with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, an experimental telescope array located near Pune, India. So we should have a good idea about what happened quite soon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="BoBBsh"&gt;Today’s photos aren’t good news, but it’s still too early to say exactly what happened during the probe’s quick descent onto Mars, nicknamed the "six minutes of terror" by ESA. Engineers are analyzing the data "day and night," the ESA says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft defends its Surface NFL tablets after the Patriots stop using them</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YQBmvdIA6UaSc7kp0hfMSwgxvY=/0x0:1483x989/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51453395/surfacesideslines.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Surface deal with the NFL made the news for all the wrong reasons again earlier this week, after Patriots coach&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13320664/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface-tablet-nfl"&gt; Bill Belichick revealed his thoughts on Microsoft's tablets&lt;/a&gt;. Belichick ranted that he was "done with the tablets" during a five-minute-long expression of pure frustration at the Surface tablets and the technology surrounding them. "I'm going to stick with pictures, which several of our other coaches do, as well, because there just isn't enough consistency in the performance of the tablets. I just can't take it anymore," said Belichick, weeks after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/2/13139174/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface"&gt;smashing a Surface tablet&lt;/a&gt; on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Microsoft responded to Belichick's concerns with a brief statement earlier this week, but now the company is going even further to defend its Surface tablets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2016/10/21/surface-and-the-nfl-changing-the-game/#bUmTEbx4c7QqFpjE.97"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft's Windows and devices corporate vice president, Yusuf Mehdi, defends the company's NFL deal at length. The post contains a variety of quotes from NFL players, coaches, and spokespeople backing up Microsoft's tablets. "We love the NFL. We love the game, the players, the coaches, and the fans," explains Mehdi. "We have deep respect for the teams -€” and the IT Pro's who work tirelessly behind the scenes to help them succeed."&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q class="right"&gt;Behind the scenes technology seems to be responsibile for issues&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It's this behind the scenes technology that appears to be at the heart of some issues that have surfaced during the NFL's use of Microsoft's tablets. Back in January, the Patriots lost to the Broncos in the AFC championship game, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835238/microsoft-surface-nfl-network-issues-response"&gt;Microsoft was quick to blame "network issues,"&lt;/a&gt; noting that "not a single issue" had been reported with the Surface tablets themselves. While Microsoft stops short of directly blaming the NFL's IT infrastructure this time, it's clear that a stadium environment is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A team of NFL IT staff is responsible for rolling out the equipment and Surface tablets, alongside ensuring network connectivity is solid. Microsoft details some of these steps, noting that the company will "continue to work with the NFL to address this complex environment and help the teams take advantage of cutting edge technology."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Mehdi's blog post defends the Surface tablets, but it fails to truly address the issues the Patriots have been experiencing. Microsoft's Surface tablets are part of a complex environment, and the company is simply admitting that it's a challenge that it needs to keep working on. That challenge will last until around 2018 at least, after Microsoft struck a five-year $400 million&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7359503/microsoft-surface-nfl-demo-hands-on"&gt; deal with the NFL&lt;/a&gt; back in 2013. That gives Microsoft enough time to figure out the IT issues behind these frustrations, and to ensure that its NFL marketing deal wasn't the ultimate fumble for its Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

The little bots have magnetic wheels on either side of a garment that keep them anchored and moving, as well as a 100mAh battery, microcontroller, and a small antenna so they can communicate with the computer directing them. They’re also relatively autonomous, so they can direct themselves back to their home base for wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p id="ZJapUE"&gt;The roveables are an adorable proof-of-concept. The researchers behind their creation think people might want to use them to create interactive clothing or jewelry. Maybe when a wearer gets a phone call, the roveables could move closer to his or her neck to double as a microphone. Or maybe the roveables could create a moving, massive display. Personally, I love the idea of a robot traveling around my body making me a better and way cooler-looking human.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Ockel Sirius A is a mobile computer that runs Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9rjyPbua7GWwy_qMeLoov1_L2c=/0x50:900x650/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51450971/ockel.0.0.png" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Around 10 years ago, before the rise of the smartphone, there was a brief moment when it looked like mobile devices were going to take a very different direction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-mobile_PC"&gt;Ultra-mobile PCs&lt;/a&gt; — small, even pocket-sized Windows computers that ran the same full versions of Windows XP or Vista as your desktop, with all the same apps — looked like they might be the future of portable computing. Obviously, history was not on the side of the UMPC, and products like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/01/05/oqo-model-01-gets-tablet-pc-os/"&gt;OQO Model 01&lt;/a&gt; or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/03/08/hands-on-with-the-samsung-q1-origami/"&gt;Samsung Q1&lt;/a&gt; have faded into relative obscurity, replaced by smaller smartphones and larger&amp;nbsp;tablets like the Surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;hr class="widget_boundry_marker hidden page_break"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ockel-sirius-a-the-world-s-most-versatile-mini-pc-mobile-design--2#/"&gt;Ockel Sirius A&lt;/a&gt; is an Indiegogo project from the Netherlands-based Ockel Computers that’s strongly reminiscent of the UMPC days of old. At less than an inch thick and with a 6-inch screen, it’s possible to view the Sirius A as a slightly bulkier Windows 10 phone. But the Sirius A manages to fit into that form factor an Intel Atom processor, 4GB of RAM, a 6-inch 1080p touchscreen, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a USB-C port, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and DisplayPort outputs. It also has a 3,000 mAh battery that can power the device for an estimated four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="360" width="640" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/185487004"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;q class="right"&gt;The Sirius A runs desktop Windows 10 applications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But most importantly, it runs the full 64-bit version of Windows 10 Home Edition. The Sirius A runs desktop Windows 10 applications, just like an ordinary Windows laptop or desktop. And while we’ve seen plenty of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10721278/kangaroo-windows-10-pc-features-ces-2016"&gt;miniature Windows computers before&lt;/a&gt; (including the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ockel-sirius-b-the-powerful-windows-10-pocket-pc-computer#/"&gt;Sirius B&lt;/a&gt;, Ockel’s original pocketable computer), the fact that the Sirius A actually has a screen that lets you use it as a mobile computer makes it stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And while there are always risks when it comes to crowdfunding campaigns, it’s worth noting that Ockel Computers successfully ran a similar campaign for the Sirius B last year, which may help alleviate concerns somewhat. The Ockel Sirius A is available to back on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ockel-sirius-a-the-world-s-most-versatile-mini-pc-mobile-design--2#/" target="_blank"&gt;Indiegogo for $599&lt;/a&gt;, with the company hoping to ship in May 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbus has a secret flying-car project called Vahana</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QKuIo0dXLUTM2mzc_HDs4Zd61Fg=/55x0:745x460/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51452351/1-7uuMgA9VvRsJRw80Q-z20A.0.png" /&gt;



      &lt;p id="wszs7m"&gt;The French aerospace giant Airbus recently unveiled its secret flying-car project dubbed Vahana — a single-manned, autonomously piloted aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Cue the &lt;em&gt;Jetsons&lt;/em&gt; references!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="Hhz13u"&gt;The concept drawing of Vahana should look familiar to anyone who follows the tiny-but-passionate flying car movement. The aircraft has eight rotors on two sets of wings, both of which tilt depending on whether the car’s flying vertically or horizontally. There’s room for a single passenger under a canopy that retracts like a visor. The aircraft will be deployed like a taxi, making it the air-taxi version of Uber, &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/20/technology/airbus-flying-taxi/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/20/technology/airbus-flying-taxi/"&gt;ccording to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/20/technology/airbus-flying-taxi/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN Money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="tSuOVt"&gt;The project launched in early 2016 as one of the first pursuits of &lt;a href="http://airbus-sv.com/"&gt;A³&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced A-cubed), the Silicon Valley arm of Airbus, according to the startup’s CEO Rodin Lyasoff. Vahana is a Sanskrit word that refers to the vehicle or mount of a god, but Lyasoff says his feet are firmly rooted in reality when it comes to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
      &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QlNzWUN3F4lT0iTkoSwuUYZWsZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7320219/0-tJmZhTYPAuQuk_YN.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Airbus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;p id="53hSKi"&gt;“Beyond developing the vehicle itself,” Lyasoff wrote in a &lt;a href="https://vahana.aero/welcome-to-vahana-edfa689f2b75#.6dl1kmcbe"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; quietly published last month, “we’re seeking to move key technology categories forward, foster development of the regulatory regime for the certification and operation of automated aircraft, and to otherwise nurture an ecosystem that will help enable the vertical cities of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="tabv1s"&gt;Airbus, which competes with the US-based Boeing, is best known for large jetliners like the double-decker A380. However, the flying car project shows that the French company is not above dabbling in some high-concept, and perhaps unrealistic, aviation ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="ST5B5H"&gt;Lyasoff says &lt;a href="https://vahana.aero/current-vahana-openings-53e1687b3554#.qxbj9n3cr"&gt;his team of engineers, designers, and robotics experts&lt;/a&gt; are aiming to fly a full-size prototype before the end of 2017, and to have a “productizable demonstrator” by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="Xq8MtL"&gt;Flying cars have&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11894268/flying-cars-photo-essay-larry-page-google"&gt; lurked in collective imaginations for decades&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea of personal, roadable aircraft took on renewed emphasis this summer when it was revealed that &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11893032/google-co-founder-larry-page-is-secretly-building-flying-cars"&gt;Google co-founder Larry Page was funding a pair of flying car startups&lt;/a&gt;, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/15/8218495/aeromobil-flying-car-2017-self-flying-car"&gt;Dozens of other companies&lt;/a&gt; are working on their own prototypes, though some probably don’t qualify as flying cars. Some are just &lt;a href="http://lilium-aviation.com/"&gt;tiny personal aircrafts&lt;/a&gt;, while others look like &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/7/11388406/volocopter-18-rotors-manned-flight-evolo-germany"&gt;drones on steroids&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tf2fCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are many things about flying cars that make them impractical&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p id="yvkJrC"&gt;The fact that flying cars act as a stand-in for some distant, unattainable future isn’t a mistake. There are many things about flying cars that make them impractical, unworkable, and even wrongheaded. Airspace in North America and Europe is tightly regulated, making it extremely difficult for any company to gain permission for commercial flight, especially in dense urban environments. And the idea of autonomous aircraft would probably strike most passengers as a recipe for disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="mmnVbY"&gt;Lyasoff insists that pilotless flying cars are an attainable dream, if only because the rules governing the skies are bound to change in the future. Plus robot aircraft are cheaper to produce. “Full automation also enables us to make our aircraft as small and light as possible, and will significantly reduce manufacturing costs,” Lyasoff says.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="DxBcAq"&gt;And if something goes wrong, the Vahana will come equipped with “a ballistic parachute that works even at low altitudes.” Because what commute is complete without a little unexpected sky-diving thrown in the mix?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="TRuihX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon’s new wireless tethering feature will change the way you take pictures</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86s_6CXJK3G6lrv-SkCuByNs-EE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51451503/nikon-d500-snapbridge-4304.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p id="IjPrg1"&gt;Nikon announced the D500, the company’s latest top-of-the-line APS-C DSLR, at &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10718416/nikon-d500-camera-aps-c-dslr-ces-2016"&gt;CES back in January&lt;/a&gt;. The $2,000 camera finally hit store shelves early this summer, and I spent a few weeks using it as my main walkaround camera. It is an exceptional camera, offering deep manual controls, the ability to shoot up to 10 frames per second, and capture 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="CSV7Ej"&gt;But the most unique feature of the D500 is that it was the first Nikon camera with Snapbridge. Snapbridge is Nikon’s way of using Bluetooth Low Energy to establish an always-on connection between your camera and your phone. It’s an evolution of the idea of a Wi-Fi-connected camera, and it’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="HmnS9K"&gt;In fact, it’s so good that Snapbridge makes every other solution for connecting your phone to a camera feel archaic. It’s really that much faster and more reliable than methods used by other camera makers. It’s not flawless — the initial connection process is buggy, and if you ever &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; the connection with your phone you have to deal with the headache of unpairing and repairing the two devices. But when Snapbridge works, which is &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;all of the time, it feels like the best possible way to quickly access, edit, and share photos from a full-size camera.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;aside id="9eHTah"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Snapbridge makes other connected cameras feel archaic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
      &lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
      &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PXFIuKLdp8FQD6BJtcVp6KJkoTc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7320459/Slack%20for%20iOS%20Upload.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p id="52qb5g"&gt;Smartphones have been eating into the camera market in a huge way over the last half decade. To staunch the bleeding, camera companies started trying to build a bridge between smartphones and their products. One of the earliest manifestations of this was the Eye-Fi card, an SD card with a small wireless radio that let you transfer photos from the card to your phone. It was a novel idea, but in practice it was always buggy, slow, or both. And recently, things somehow got even worse for Eye-Fi users — the company is phasing out its older Wi-Fi SD cards and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/10/12427384/eye-fi-x2-sd-cards-software-end-of-life"&gt;users are going to lose some of that functionality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="UcR6rd"&gt;Around the same time that Eye-Fi hit the scene, companies started building Wi-Fi right into their cameras. This let you shoot photos, pull out your phone, open an app, and gain access to the files that you just created with that camera. Wi-Fi also allowed for relatively fast file transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="JLznDb"&gt;What Nikon has done with Snapbridge is similar in many ways. You shoot with the D500 (or other new Snapbridge-equipped Nikon product, like the D3400, or the company’s forthcoming action cameras), and then you’re able to access those photos on your smartphone via the Snapbridge app, download the ones you like, and post, edit, or share them to your heart’s desire. You're essentially wirelessly tethering the camera to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
      &lt;img alt=" " src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8EM7ox2FqdJ34-PA9NvnDCg2aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7318585/nikon-d500-snapbridge-4294.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;p id="mDmfTK"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;difference is that always on connection. Snapbridge uses Bluetooth Low Energy to connect to your phone, which means that pairing stays put even if you turn the D500 off. (It even remains if you swap out the camera’s battery!) Using BLE also means that the camera won’t drain your phone’s battery, too. Better yet, it eliminates the most annoying part of using Wi-Fi on cameras, which is that you always have to reconnect your phone to the camera, either because your phone jumped to another Wi-Fi connection or because the camera powered down its Wi-Fi radio. (This was always especially annoying on iPhones, where you’d have to constantly go back to the settings menu to reconnect to the camera’s Wi-Fi.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="vpKkDE"&gt;One of the reasons camera companies hadn’t turned to BLE is because the transfer speeds can be slow. The D500 even takes around 10 seconds to transfer full resolution photos, and it won’t work with RAW files. But Snapbridge defaults to creating and transferring 2-megapixel versions of the photos you take. That’s just high-resolution enough to look fine on Instagram and, in many cases, even Facebook. (You can definitely tell the difference between the low-res images and full-resolution ones on a Retina screen, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ctx17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My favorite thing about Snapbridge is the feature I thought I would hate the most&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p id="Bf4S3S"&gt;My favorite thing about Snapbridge is the feature I thought I would hate the most. The app has a mode that lets the camera automatically send those 2-megapixel versions of &lt;em&gt;every photo you take&lt;/em&gt; to your phone. I’m a total over-shooter — I like to rely heavily on burst shooting to make sure I get the right shot and get it in focus — so I was skeptical of this aspect of Snapbridge. But I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="k3ZTHe"&gt;Knowing that every photo was being transferred to my phone made me dial back the amount of burst shooting I did with the D500 (a tough decision to make, I might add, since the D500 can shoot a thrilling 10 frames per second). I became more decisive with what I shot. And even during moments when I wasn’t, the 2-megapixel files didn’t bog down my 64GB iPhone. (An aside: Snapbridge is available on both Android and iOS, but I used it most with my iPhone 6. iPhones tend to be frustrating when it comes to wireless connections — especially Wi-Fi — so I was expecting Snapbridge to be a problem. It’s not!)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p id="HKLGxy"&gt;With the D500 and Snapbridge, I almost completely ignored my iPhone’s camera. It was like I didn’t need it anymore. Every time I wanted to take a picture I opted for the D500, knowing that in a few seconds it would be waiting for me on my phone. The ultimate example of this was at a friend’s wedding. Normally, I’d have posted photos from my iPhone to Instagram and Facebook using the hashtag for the wedding. But this time around I had Snapbridge and the D500, so I shot more confidently and was able to produce and share better results without any extra lag.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="Zy2Qmj"&gt;I love how far smartphone cameras have come, but I’m still a big believer in &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/20/7852911/why-you-should-buy-a-camera"&gt;carrying around a more capable camera&lt;/a&gt;. Until now that decision has involved a tradeoff: you gain a significant boost in quality at the cost of instant gratification. Snapbridge is the kind of feature that helps break down all the steps that separate those two sides of the equation. With it, you really get the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="iDV4lO"&gt;Snapbridge is one small part of the D500’s experience, which again, is a superb (and relatively expensive) camera. But Snapbridge is also quickly becoming a flagship feature of all of Nikon’s new cameras — something that’s made me, a lifelong Canon shooter, consider jumping ship. The convenience of having a camera on your smartphone — especially one that’s as good as what you find &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13304476/google-pixel-vs-iphone-7-samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-camera-comparison"&gt;on the iPhone 7, Google Pixel, and Galaxy S7 Edge&lt;/a&gt; — is hard to beat. But Snapbridge, and the inevitable copycat ideas that will follow, has a chance to shift the power back to standalone cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in 'advanced talks' to buy Time Warner</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFGlUsdebamaDmSOGvNMyz-Ba4Q=/0x0:2039x1359/1310x873/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51452063/att1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Time Warner, the owner of numerous popular TV networks including HBO, are fast approaching an acquisition deal. After&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/at-t-said-to-discuss-idea-of-takeover-in-time-warner-meetings"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/i&gt; reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that there had been "informal talks" between senior-level AT&amp;amp;T and Time Warner executives,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-is-in-advanced-talks-to-acquire-time-warner-1477061850?mod=BNM/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journa&lt;/i&gt;l is now&lt;/a&gt; putting those discussions at an "advanced" stage and says a deal could be imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The talks "have come together quickly, are fluid, and still could fall through," according to the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt;. So there's still room for this to fall apart, but trading of Time Warner stock has been temporary halted owing to the news. AT&amp;amp;T had no comment when contacted by &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T's acquisition offer would be a combination of cash and stock, according to the &lt;i&gt;Journal's&lt;/i&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Such a deal would unite AT&amp;amp;T's various mobile and TV provider holdings — AT&amp;amp;T Wireless, DirecTV, U-Verse, etc. — with Time Warner's massive list of subsidiaries including HBO, TNT, TBS, CNN, Turner Sports, Warner Bros. Entertainment, DC Entertainment, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Both companies have a mixed history with acquisitions and mergers; AT&amp;amp;T recently bought satellite provider DirecTV, a recovery from its devastating, failed bid for T-Mobile US several years prior. Two years ago, Time Warner rejected a buyout offer from 21st Century Fox, but &lt;i&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/i&gt; claims CEO Jeff Bewkes remains "a willing seller if he gets an offer he thinks is fair." The company's previous merger with AOL is widely panned as one of the worst mergers in history.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Once Apple announced the completely wireless AirPods, it was only a matter of time before the competition released their own versions of wire-free earbuds, and JLab Audio is the latest to jump in the fray. The company has announced the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.jlabaudio.com/pages/epic-air"&gt;JLab Audio Epic Air&lt;/a&gt;, an evolution from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/9/12404118/bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-running-jbl-beats-jaybird"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;favorite&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/9/12404118/bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-running-jbl-beats-jaybird"&gt; Epic2&lt;/a&gt; earbuds. The Epic Air features an earhook that doubles as a Bluetooth antenna, which the company says will increase the strength of the earbuds' connection to your device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;JLab Audio says the Epic Air will last for six hours on a single charge, but the included charging case can add up to 30 hours of battery life when fully charged up. (The case can also charge your smartphone or other devices, which is a nice touch.) The Epic Air headphones are rated IPX5 splashproof, so sweat or rising them off in the sink won't damage them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Touch controls are also present; tap on the right earbud to skip forward or backward, and tap the left to play or pause your music. The JLab Audio Epic Air headphones won't be available in stores until February of next year, but you can&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.jlabaudio.com/pages/epic-air"&gt;preorder&lt;/a&gt; them from JLab Audio's website for $149 today.&lt;/p&gt;
